# Omar Alvarez

I am a highly driven software engineer with a desire to expand my existing skill set in web development and embrace new opportunities. I have experience with a variety of languages and frameworks enabling me to produce modern applications in line with SOLID principles, design patterns and best practices. Self organised and a strong team worker I am able to adapt to new environments quickly and effectively.

## Skills

#### Programming skills

- **Languages, Frameworks and Databases**: Ruby (Sinatra and Ruby on Rails), Elixir (Phoenix), JavaScript (React.js, Redux), Postgres SQL, MongoDB, Redis.
- **Testing**: Rspec, ExUnit, Jasmine, Capybara, Jest.
- **Web**: Version control with GitHub, Continuous integration with TeamCity, Heroku, API integration (Spotify, Guardian API, Wunderground, Yelp API, Cloudinary). Design and implementation of several microservices.
- **Practices**: XP-values and practices, SOLID Principles, Test Driven Development, Agile methodology.

#### Image Processing

- I have implemented different applications for digital treatment of images and sound that helped me to learn programming in different languages such as C/C++, MATLAB, Python and Java. I also gained a greater understanding of the mathematical methods for signal processing.
- Understanding of codecs H.264.
- H.264 file parsing for extraction of statistics for the accommodation of the bit stream video watermarking system. (Done in C++).
- Understanding of multiplatform delivery technologies (mobile, desktop, OTT devices).
- Development of two Plug­ins (SeamCarving and Denoising) for the [TuttleOFX](https://sites.google.com/site/tuttleofx/) library and tested in the compositing software Nuke.

#### Other skills

- I have worked in multicultural and multidisciplinary teams that gave me good communicational skills, being able to travel often and use 3 languages on a daily basis.
- Not afraid of failure: For the last 16 weeks I have been exposed to completely new topics, challenges and situations that can be overwhelming. I know how to learn from failure and I I trust my abilities to cope and adapt.
- Independent and quick learner: I am a passionate learner and enjoy reading and discovering multiple areas (not just coding), such as painting (I've painted more than 15 pictures using different techniques), music (I can play more than 8 instruments and still have no idea how to read music), languages (I learned the basics of french on my own before taking the adventure of moving to France looking for new career opportunities).
