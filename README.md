# Omar Alvarez

I am looking for a new career opportunity after three years in the broadcasting industry in Paris. My desire is to redirect my career towards a more technical field where I can use my design and programming skills within a team. I have always had an interest in video and image processing.  Currently I am doing a course by Makers Academy (London) in web development involving new languages and frameworks used on modern applications such as Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and JavaScript. My personal objective is to combine my existing knowledge in the audiovisual field with the latest web technologies in today's marketplace.

#### Image Processing

- I have implemented different applications for digital treatment of images and sound that helped me to learn programming in different languages such as C/C++, MATLAB, Python and Java. I also gained a greater understanding of the mathematical methods for signal processing.
- Understanding of codecs H.264.
- H.264 file parsing for extraction of statistics for the accommodation of the bit stream video watermarking system. (Done in C++).
- Understanding of multiplatform delivery technologies (mobile, desktop, OTT devices).

#### Customer oriented skills

- I have worked in multicultural and multidisciplinar teams and that gave me good communicational skills, being able to travel often and use 3 languages on my daily basis.
